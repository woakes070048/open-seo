# OpenSEO

OpenSEO is an SEO tool for _the people_. If tools like Semrush or Ahrefs are too expensive or bloated, OpenSEO is a pay by usage alternative that you actually control.

## Pricing / Costs

OpenSEO is totally free to use. It works by using DataForSEO's APIs, which is a paid third-party service unaffiliated with OpenSEO.

There are two separate things:

1. OpenSEO app cost: $0, you host it yourself.
2. DataForSEO API: pay-as-you-go based on usage.

For cost estimates, see [DataForSEO API Cost Reference](#seo-api-cost-reference).

## Self Hosting (Deploy on Cloudflare) [5-10 minutes]

> [!TIP]
> If anything in this section is confusing or unfamiliar like running terminal commands, copy this link into ChatGPT or Claude and ask it explain.


OpenSEO is built on [Every App](https://github.com/every-app/every-app), a platform for easily self-hosting open source apps like OpenSEO in your own Cloudflare account. Cloudflare enables much more powerful functionality than is possible running on your own computer or on a VPS.

_Windows Users_

This has not been tested on Windows. Please let me know if you run into problems. Using WSL will likely work better. Also, try using [fly.io Sprites](https://sprites.dev/) to get a linux sandbox for free if you get totally stuck.

### Prerequisites

If you don't want to make a Cloudflare account yet (its easy!) and just want to test out OpenSEO, skip to the [Run Locally](#seo-api-cost-reference) section.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes `npx`).
2. Create a Cloudflare account: [dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
3. Authenticate Wrangler:

```sh
npx wrangler login
```

4. Deploy the Every App Gateway (one-time per account):

```sh
npx everyapp gateway deploy
```

5. Create an Account

- Follow the link output by the last command to create an account. You will access OpenSEO through this account.

### Self Host OpenSEO
Deploy the app to cloudflare.

1. Clone the repo to your machine
```sh
git clone https://github.com/every-app/open-seo.git
```
2. Switch to the directory
```sh
cd open-seo
```
3. Self host via the Every App CLI
```sh
npx everyapp app deploy
```

#### DataForSEO API Key Setup [5 minutes]
OpenSEO use DataForSEO to get the SEO info. You need an API key to connect OpenSEO to the service.

1. Go to [DataForSEO API Access](https://app.dataforseo.com/api-access).
2. Request API credentials by email (`API key by email` or `API password by email`).
3. Use your DataForSEO login + API password, then base64 encode `login:password`:

```sh
printf '%s' 'YOUR_LOGIN:YOUR_PASSWORD' | base64
```

4. Set this as a secret in Cloudflare. Use the value from the previous step when prompted.
```sh
npx wrangler secret put DATAFORSEO_API_KEY
```

Now you're all set! Go back to the gateway, click on the OpenSEO app, and start getting better at SEO!


## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- A DataForSEO account/API credentials

### Run Locally (Quick Test)

1. Copy env template:

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

2. Install and run:

```sh
pnpm install
# This runs in BYPASS_GATEWAY mode so that you don't need to set up the Every App gateway. This is fine for local use.
pnpm dev:agents
```

App runs on `http://localhost:3001` by default (or `PORT` from `.env.local`).

Running locally is the fastest way to test core flows. In the future, local mode will not include some Cloudflare-backed capabilities (for example cron-based rank tracking and infrastructure-powered performance improvements for heavier audits).

### Local Development Workflow (for coding agents)

```sh
# This log file make it easier for your coding agent to debug.
mkdir .logs
touch .logs/dev-server.log
# terminal 1: start once and keep running
pnpm dev:agents
```

- `pnpm dev:agents` mirrors output to `.logs/dev-server.log` (gitignored).
- The log file is overwritten on each run.
- If you need a different port, set `PORT` in `.env.local` and restart.

### Database Commands

Generate migration:

```sh
pnpm run db:generate
```

Migrate local DB:

```sh
pnpm run db:migrate:local
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome.

- Open an issue for bugs, UX friction, or feature requests.
- Open a PR if you want to implement a feature directly.
- Community-driven improvements are prioritized, and high-quality PRs are encouraged.

If you want to contribute but are unsure where to start, open an issue and describe what you want to build.

## SEO API Cost Reference

Use this section to estimate DataForSEO spend per request type. OpenSEO itself remains free; these are API usage costs only.

As of February 26, 2026, DataForSEO’s public docs/pricing pages say:

- New accounts include **$1 free credit** to test the API.
- The minimum top-up/payment is **$50**.

That means you can try OpenSEO for free with the starter credit, then decide if/when to top up.

### Pricing sources

- DataForSEO Labs pricing: https://dataforseo.com/pricing/dataforseo-labs/dataforseo-google-api
- Google PageSpeed Insights API docs: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started

### 1) Site audit

- No paid API calls in the current implementation.

### 2) Keyword research (`related` mode)

- Current billed cost pattern (from account usage logs):
  - `0.02 + (0.0001 x returned_keywords)` USD
- Default app setting: `150` results per search (`$0.035` each).
- Available result tiers:
  - 150 results = `$0.035`
  - 300 results = `$0.05`
  - 500 results = `$0.07`

### 3) Domain overview

- Standard domain overview request (with top 200 ranked keywords): `$0.0401` per domain.
- General formula if needed:
  - `0.0201 + (0.0001 x ranked_keywords_returned)` USD

### Planning examples

- 100 keyword research requests at the default 150 results: `$3.50`
- 100 keyword research requests at 500 results each: `$7.00`
- 100 domain overviews (200 ranked keywords each): `$4.01`
